    <h2>DObliviate</h2>
    <strong>A Daily Obliviate Charm helps you erase your memories (i.e. filter your mobile gallery) day-to-day.</strong>

**WARNING!** Works only on Android OS.

## Main Idea

The main idea came when I found myself running out of space, and that my gallery was totally chaotic and trashed by a bunch of shaky camera photos, Internet images downloaded, but mostly memes that were sent to me or to someone, and now they're useless to stay.  
So, you may just need a daily reminder and quick access to today's images, so you can filter them everyday, and then here's the job of DObliviate.

## Name Origin

The name was derived from **D**aily **Obliviate**

[**Oblivate**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=obliviate)  
_(transitive verb)_  
`\ob·​liv·​i·​ate\`

Originating from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets also Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1, Obliviate is a term meaning 'forget'. Obliviate is a memory charm, resulting in the erasure of the recipients memory. Now it is used as a verb, such as
_`'I obliviated my math homework at home'`_

[The Memory Charm](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Memory_Charm) (Obliviate), also known as the Forgetfulness Charm, is a charm that can be used to erase specific memories from an individual's mind.

## Personal Aim

I built DObliviate for the sake of practicing and learning more about [flutter framework](https://flutter.dev/) and [Bloc state management design pattern.](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/)
